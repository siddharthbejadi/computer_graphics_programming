### Figure 1 – Q1: Circle in Square

I created a project in **Visual Studio Community** using **C# Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)**.

- Renamed `Form1.cs` to `SimpleDrawing.cs`
- Pasted the provided drawing code into the form
- Solved **Q1: Circle in Square** by editing the **coordinates of the circle** so that it fits correctly inside the rectangle

This implementation demonstrates basic 2D drawing concepts using **Windows Forms Graphics**.
